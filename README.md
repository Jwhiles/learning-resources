I'm going to use this repository to keep track of interesting and high quality learning resources,

https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial  - learn enough command line to be dangerous. Very good video tutorials

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts - weird parts of javascript - gave me a better understanding of how javascript works,
makes it easier to predict what my code will do.
